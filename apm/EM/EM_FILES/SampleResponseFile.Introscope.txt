# How to install silently and use this file: 
#
# Introscope can be installed in silent mode (i.e. requiring no interaction 
# with a GUI or console). Introscope installations of version 8.x or higher 
# can be upgraded in silent mode. Silent installations and upgrades use the 
# settings specified in a response file. 
#
# Silent installations and upgrades can be performed as follows:
#
# Edit this file to reflect your preferred settings.
# Place this file in any directory. 
# If upgrading, ensure that your existing installation is fully backed up
# and all Introscope processes are shut down.
# Select the appropriate command format from the list below,
# and enter it at the command line to invoke the installer:
#
#   installer.exe -f <absolute path to response file>
#   installer.bin -f <absolute path to response file>
#   java -classpath installer.jar install -f <absolute path to response file>
#
# Note for upgrades only: 
# The upgrade procedure is not reversible. CA APM recommends creating a full 
# backup of your Introscope installation before initiating an upgrade.

# General Settings
#
# ================

# Specify the location of CA End User License Agreement (EULA)
# file. This agreement must be acknowledged and accepted 
# by the end user in order for installation to proceed. To acknowledge  
# and accept the agreement:
#   - open it in a text editor and read the terms and conditions 
#   - edit the end of the file to indicate acceptance of the license 
#   - save the changes
#   - specify the agreement's location using the property below
# The CA EULA location may be specified with an absolute or relative path.
# Relative paths will be resolved relative to the installer launch directory.
# On Windows, backslashes must be escaped.
#    Example Windows value: C:\\Documents and Settings\\ca-eula.txt
#    Example Unix value:    /home/myuser/ca-eula.txt
ca-eulaFile=ca-eula.txt
  
# Directory where Introscope is to be installed.
# The directory path must be absolute, not relative.
# On all platforms, the path must end with a file separator.
# On Windows, backslashes must be escaped.
# Example Windows install directory: C:\\IntroscopeSilentInstall\\
# Example Unix install directory: /IntroscopeSilentInstall/
# Left blank, this property will default to one of the following values: 
# On Windows...
#    C:\\Program Files\\CA APM\\Introscope10.6.0.178\\ 
#        (Exact name and drive letter of program files directory may vary 
#        depending on OS configuration) 
# On Unix...

# Introscope features to install. Must be a comma-delimited list.
# Example: Enterprise Manager,WebView,Command Center Server,AO Platform
# The APM database stores Business Services and Application Dependency Map information.
# This database is deployed on a PostgreSQL database.
# If you want to install APM database only, use,
# silentInstallChosenFeatures=Database
# To install database along with EM add "Database" to the property below
# Ensure that you also specify databaseDir, dbAdminUser and dbAdminPassword properties
# below if you want to install APM database.
# If you want to perform CA AO Platform Integration Only,use,
# silentInstallChosenFeatures=AO Platform
# Ensure that you also specify EM_HOME property below if you want to integrate CA AO Platform with existing Enterprise Manager

########################
# Upgrade Settings
#
# ================

# To perform a silent upgrade of an existing Introscope 8.x or later installation,
# configure this responsefile as follows:
#   1) Set the upgrade property in this section to true. 
#   2) Set the USER_INSTALL_DIR property, in the above section, such that it
#      points to a valid Introscope 8.x or 9.x directory, using valid syntax. 
#   3) Set the externalComponentPackage and eulaFile properties, in the above 
#      section, such that they point to a valid component package and license
#      agreement, using valid syntax. The installer will recognize the license 
#      agreement as valid only if you have edited it to indicate acceptance 
#      of the agreement.
#   4) Optionally, to rename the Introscope install directory during an upgrade,
#      uncomment the install dir property in this section and set it
#      to the new value.
#   5) Optionally, to change Windows service names and service display names 
#      during an upgrade, go to the "Windows Service Settings" sections 
#      of this file and:
#        a) set the switches to true
#        b) set the service and display names to their new values
# The upgrade procedure is not reversible. CA APM recommends creating a full 
# backup of your Introscope installation before initiating an upgrade.
shouldUpgrade=false

# To rename the Introscope install directory during an upgrade,
# uncomment this property and specify a new name and location 
# for the upgraded directory.
# Use the same syntax as for the USER_INSTALL_DIR property:
# append a trailing slash; escape backslashes on Windows.
#      Example Windows value: C:\\IntroscopeSilentlyUpgradedInstall\\
#      Example Unix value: /IntroscopeSilentlyUpgradedInstall/
#upgradedInstallDir=

# To take backup of the existing installation during an upgrade,
# uncomment this property. Set the property to false to not take backup.
# This property is used when EM is being upgraded and also for DB only upgrades.
# Defaults to true.
