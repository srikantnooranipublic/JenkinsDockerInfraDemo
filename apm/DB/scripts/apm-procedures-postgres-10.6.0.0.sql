--	purge_apm_data_function purges the data that is older than pruning_time_in_seconds + aging_time_in_seconds.
--
--	Core Logic:
--	1. Delete all the edges that qualifies for deletion i.e. update_date < current_timestamp - (pruning_time_in_seconds + aging_time_in_seconds).
--	2. Delete  vertices that are no longer referenced in Edge table.
--	3. Delete  owners that are no longer referenced in Edge table.
